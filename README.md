# tinywiki
I think it would be a good idea to implement support for the following:
- multiple users (heirachies, permissions, etc)
- separate authoring and viewing tools (decentralized and distributed data authoring)
- (optional) collection of read and write metrics (local only)
- advanced search (full text, partial text, handle typos, etc)
- advanced support for versioning, backups, exporting, etc
